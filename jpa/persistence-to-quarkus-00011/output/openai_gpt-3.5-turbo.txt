## Reasoning
1. The issue found in the static code analysis is that using `@PersistenceContext` in Java EE is not needed in Quarkus, as Quarkus automatically creates the bean when the datasource is correctly set up.
2. The `@Produces` annotation on the `EntityManager` is illegal in Quarkus, so it needs to be removed.
3. If the producer is still needed, a qualification for the produced `EntityManager` needs to be created, along with every injection point for the `EntityManager`.
4. In the solved example, a new qualifier `@ExtendedContext` was created to inject the `EntityManager`.
5. The `@RequestScoped` annotation needs to be replaced with `@SessionScoped` in Quarkus due to the loss of `ConversationScoped`.
6. The `FacesContext` producer method can be removed as it is not relevant in Quarkus.
