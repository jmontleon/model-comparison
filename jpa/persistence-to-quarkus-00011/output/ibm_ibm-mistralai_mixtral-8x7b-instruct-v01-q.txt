## Reasoning

1. The first step is to analyze the issue found in the JavaEE code. The issue is that the `@PersistenceContext` annotation is used to inject a data source in JavaEE/JakartaEE, but in Quarkus, a datasource is configured and the `@Produces` annotation on the `EntityManager` is not needed.
2. The solved example shows how we handled a similar issue in the past. We changed the scope of the `Resources` class from `@Stateful @RequestScoped` to `@SessionScoped` and removed the `@Produces` annotation from the `getEm()` method.
3. In the input file, we see that the `Resources` class is `@RequestScoped` and has a `@Produces` annotation on the `getEm()` method.
4. To fix the issue, we need to change the scope of the `Resources` class to `@SessionScoped` and remove the `@Produces` annotation from the `getEm()` method.
5. We also need to add the `@ExtendedContext` qualifier to the `getEm()` method and every injection point for the `EntityManager`.
6. The `FacesContext` producer method is not needed in Quarkus, so we can remove it.
7. The `PersistenceContextType` import needs to be changed from `javax.persistence` to `jakarta.persistence`.
8. The `EntityManager` import needs to be changed from `javax.persistence` to `jakarta.persistence`.
9. The `InjectionPoint` import needs to be changed from `javax.enterprise.inject.spi` to `jakarta.enterprise.inject`.
10. The `FacesContext` import needs to be removed.

    // Expose an entity manager using the resource producer pattern
    @PersistenceContext

    @Produces
    @ExtendedContext

        return em;
    }
