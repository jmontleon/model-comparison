    ## Step 1
    The first step is to remove the `@Remote` annotation from the class and replace it with a `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path("<endpoint>")` annotation.
    The endpoint path should be specified in place of `<endpoint>` to specify the actual path to the REST service.
    The `@Stateless` annotation should also be removed as REST services are stateless by nature.

    ## Step 2
    For every public method on the EJB being converted, do the following:
    - Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.GET`
    - Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path("<endpoint>")` and give it a proper endpoint path.
    - Add `@jakarta.ws.rs.QueryParam("<param-name>")` to any method parameters if needed, where `<param-name>` is a name for the parameter.
