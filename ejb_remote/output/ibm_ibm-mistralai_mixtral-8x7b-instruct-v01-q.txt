## Reasoning

1. The first step is to address the issue found from the static code analysis, which is the use of Remote EJBs. This is not supported in Quarkus and needs to be replaced with REST functionality.

2. The `@Remote` annotation on the class needs to be replaced with a `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path` annotation. An endpoint must be added to the annotation to specify the actual path to the REST service.

3. The `@Stateless` annotation is unnecessary for REST services as they are stateless by nature, so it should be removed.

4. For every public method on the EJB being converted, we need to annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.GET` and `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path`. Also, we need to add `@jakarta.ws.rs.QueryParam` to any method parameters if needed.

5. In this example, we will annotate the `increment`, `decrement`, and `getCount` methods with `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path` and use the method name as endpoint. Since there are no parameters, we don't need to add `@jakarta.ws.rs.QueryParam`.

6. We also need to update the pom.xml file to remove any dependencies that are not needed in Quarkus, such as the EJB dependencies.

Note: The package name and class name are not changed, but it is recommended to change the package name to follow the Quarkus naming conventions.

Additionally, the pom.xml file needs to be updated to remove any dependencies that are not needed in Quarkus, such as the EJB dependencies, and add any new dependencies that are required for the REST functionality.

Please let me know if you need more information about the pom.xml file.
