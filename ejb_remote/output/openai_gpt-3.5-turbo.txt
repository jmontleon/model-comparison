## Reasoning
1. The first step is to remove the `@Remote` annotation from the class since Remote EJBs are not supported in Quarkus.
2. Next, we need to replace the `@Stateful` annotation with REST functionality as Quarkus promotes stateless services.
3. For each method in the class, we need to annotate them with `@jakarta.ws.rs.GET` and `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path("<endpoint>")` to expose them as REST endpoints.
4. We also need to add `@jakarta.ws.rs.QueryParam("<param-name>")` to any method parameters if needed.
