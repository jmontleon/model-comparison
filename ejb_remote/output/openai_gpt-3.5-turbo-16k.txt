## Reasoning

1. The first step is to remove the `@Remote` annotation on the class since Remote EJBs are not supported in Quarkus. Instead, we will replace it with a `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path("<endpoint>")` annotation. This annotation is used to specify the actual path to the REST service. We need to provide a proper endpoint path in place of `<endpoint>`.

2. The `@Stateful` annotation is not required in Quarkus since REST services are stateless by nature. Therefore, we can remove the `@Stateful` annotation if present.

3. For each public method in the EJB being converted, we need to make the following changes:
   - Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.GET` to indicate that it is a GET request.
   - Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path("<endpoint>")` and provide a proper endpoint path. As a rule of thumb, we can use the method name as the endpoint.
   - Add `@jakarta.ws.rs.QueryParam("<param-name>")` to any method parameters if needed. This annotation is used to specify a query parameter for the method.
